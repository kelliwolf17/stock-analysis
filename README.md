# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to be able to analyize the Total Daily Volume and Returns for each ticker symbol from the data Steve provided. He originally wanted to determine whether or not Daqo (DQ) was a good investment, but has since wanted to look at other investment options for his parents.
# Results
The outputs for 2017 and 2018 are seen in the next section. The Total Daily Volumes match the module, but the Returns are slightly off. I believe this to be a rounding error at some point in the formatting code. 
## Stock Performace Comparison
See the results for 2017 and 2018 stock performance. RUN and TERP were the only stocks to improve from 2017 to 2018, though TERP still had negative returns.

## Script Performance Comparison
The execution times from the original script to the refactored script improved significantly. For example, the original script ran in 0.766 seconds whereas the refactored code ran in 0.230 seconds. 

# Summary
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? How do the pros and cons apply to refcaotring the original VBA code?
