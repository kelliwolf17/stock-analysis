# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to be able to analyize the Total Daily Volume and Returns for each ticker symbol from the data Steve provided. He originally wanted to determine whether or not Daqo (DQ) was a good investment, but has since wanted to look at other investment options for his parents.
# Results
The outputs for 2017 and 2018 are seen in the next section. The Total Daily Volumes match the module, but the Returns are slightly off. I believe this to be a rounding error at some point in the code.
